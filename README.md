# Machine-Learning

Used different datasets from Kaggle and performed various pre processing and exploratory data analysis techniques.
Implemented machine learning algorithms like:
1) Linear Regression
2) Decision Tree - ID3 and CART
3) Candidate Elimination algorithm
4) K-Nearest Neighbours
5) Artifial Neural Networks
6) SVM
7) Bagging Ensembles including Bagged Decision Trees, Random Forest and Extra Trees
8) Boosting Ensembles including AdaBoost and Stochastic Gradient Boosting.
9) Voting Ensembles for averaging the predictions for any arbitrary models.
10) Hierarchical clustering
11) Gaussian Mixture Model Using the Expectation Maximization
12) K‐means Clustering.
13) K‐mode clustering.
14) Implement Principle Component Analysis for Dimensionality Reduction
